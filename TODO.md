## Priorities and Functionality Enhancements

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
#### 1. **Authentication Workflow**
- [ ] **Valid Wallet/Token Check**: Ensure the authentication middleware can validate user wallets and tokens.
- [ ] **Error Handling for Invalid Login**: Return specific error messages for failed login attempts.
- [ ] **Token-Based Authentication**: Use JWT or a similar mechanism for secure user sessions.
- [ ] **Secure API Requests**: Implement encryption and secure communication between the frontend and backend.

#### 2. **Transaction Workflow**
- [ ] **Transaction Validation**: Validate transaction requests for sufficient balance, valid recipient addresses, and required fields.
- [ ] **Error Handling for Transactions**: Return detailed error messages for failed transactions.
- [ ] **Blockchain Execution**: Ensure Tatum can execute transactions and return confirmations to the interface.
- [ ] **Confirmation Response**: Format transaction confirmations for user-friendly display in the frontend.

#### 3. **Data Query Workflow**
- [ ] **Query Validation**: Verify that incoming data queries from the frontend are correctly formatted and authorized.
- [ ] **Blockchain Data Fetching**: Implement efficient methods to fetch user-specific data (e.g., balance, transaction history).
- [ ] **Error Handling for Missing Data**: Return "No Data Found" or other appropriate errors when applicable.

### High Priority
#### 4. **Interface Enhancements**
- [ ] **Data Processing Layer**: Create a middleware layer for processing and validating data between the frontend and backend.
- [ ] **Standardized Error Responses**: Define a universal error format to standardize how errors are communicated to the frontend.
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Provide detailed API documentation for frontend-backend communication.

#### 5. **Frontend Usability**
- [ ] **Real-Time Feedback**: Add real-time status updates for login, transactions, and data queries.
- [ ] **Interactive Dashboard**: Build a user-friendly interface for displaying balances, transaction history, and blockchain activity.

### Suggested Features
#### 6. **Authentication Extensions**
- [ ] **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add optional MFA for enhanced security.
- [ ] **OAuth Integration**: Allow login via third-party platforms (e.g., Google, MetaMask).

#### 7. **Advanced Transaction Features**
- [ ] **Batch Transactions**: Support for executing multiple transactions in one request.
- [ ] **Recurring Transactions**: Enable users to schedule recurring transactions on the blockchain.

#### 8. **Enhanced Data Query Features**
- [ ] **Advanced Filtering**: Allow users to filter transaction history by date, type, or status.
- [ ] **Export Functionality**: Add support for exporting data (e.g., CSV or JSON).

#### 9. **Decision Logic Enhancements**
- [ ] **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement automatic retries for failed API calls due to network issues.
- [ ] **Fallback Systems**: Provide alternative workflows for handling system failures (e.g., switch to secondary APIs).

#### 10. **Performance Optimizations**
- [ ] **Caching**: Add caching for frequently accessed data to reduce load times.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Protect the system from abuse by limiting API request rates.

### Future Considerations
#### 11. **Scalability**
- [ ] **Load Balancing**: Distribute API calls across multiple servers to ensure scalability.
- [ ] **Database Optimization**: Optimize data storage and retrieval processes for large-scale operations.

#### 12. **Blockchain Agnosticism**
- [ ] **Multi-Chain Support**: Enable compatibility with multiple blockchain networks.
- [ ] **Smart Contract Interaction**: Provide tools for interacting with custom smart contracts.

#### 13. **Analytics and Reporting**
- [ ] **User Activity Analytics**: Track and analyze user behavior for insights.
- [ ] **System Health Monitoring**: Add tools to monitor API performance and blockchain interaction.
